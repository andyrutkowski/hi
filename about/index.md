I am a visualization librarian at USC Libraries. I work with maps, data, and a range of tools and software to help explore and work through research problems and questions.  

I approach my work from an ethical framework that includes considering how the data and tools that we use are not nuetral and should be put into question as part of the research process.   

I am particularly interested in introducing researchers to new methods and ways of thinking about their research.
