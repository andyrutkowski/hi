I will be teaching a workshop at the 2018 DLF called Digital Mapping Ecosystems. This workshop has been a work in progress for several years and I wanted to give a little background of why I wanted to do it at DLF and some of the goals and outcomes that I envision.

There are two sets of motivating factors that have helped to shape the workshop. One is based on a frequent request that I have encountered from students, faculty, and colleagues that involves creating an online map that has several layers of data, including a historical basemap layer. The other is thinking more and more about what does critical cartography mean in an academic environment, especially from the point of view of libraries.

The workshop then is meant to be an incubator for thinking through these two problems and helping to provide a framework for when we talk with researchers about mapping, data, tools, project management, reproducibility, accessibility, and a range of other issues. In particular, the workshop aims to address how we as librarians can better become part of the research process and work with researchers so that they have a better appreciation of all the different things that must happen in order for a digital mapping project to exist in the first place.

The idea of the ecosystem is that any mapping or digital project will necessarily have parts and pieces from all sorts of different places. The aim is to show how some of these tools overlap, how they can be used with one another, and how you can work with them more directly. 

Some of the questions that have guided me in the process of developing this workshop include:

* How can spatial and other visualization methods help to answer or enrich research questions?
* What are the ethical implications of using propriety vs. free tools? 
* What do data management best practices look like for a digital mapping research project?
* What kind of role can visualization, GIS, and other librarians play in providing research support when tools and software are essential to a project?
*How we can provide a workshop model that moves beyond teaching tools and instead facilitate a space to talk about the process and methods of mapping.
 
For this workshop I have focused on CARTO, Mapbox, and Github as a provisional set of tools and platforms that can help to create a personal research environment that not only allows you to work with and manage multiple layers of spatial data, but one with which you can also publish and share your project online. Moreover, these tools provide a counter example to the more mainstream alternative of ArcGIS which is often the default choice for working and publishing map related projects. In addition, CARTO has recently partnered with Github to become part of a student developer pack of tools and software. This is a new model that needs to be explored by libraries and how it might impact instruction and outreach. The workshop is easily adaptable to other tools and software, such as Tableau, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS desktop, and QGIS. 

I have selected data and maps from an ongoing research project that I hope will resonate with others as well as be adaptable. The workshop will use data from the Green Book, the Homeowner's Loan Corporation, as well as various local Los Angeles based data. Most participants will be able to replicate some form of this research project with their own local communities.

The workshop started to take shape after last years DLF in which I helped to organize a panel on [Critical Cartography](https://dlfforum2017.sched.com/event/Bzsk/t3b-critical-cartography-across-the-digital-library).
