I will be teaching a workshop at the 2018 DLF in Las Vegas called Digital Mapping Ecosystems. This workshop has been a work in progress for several years and I wanted to give a little background of why I wanted to do it at DLF and some of the goals and outcomes that I envision.

There are two sets of motivating factors that have helped to shape the workshop. One is based on a frequent request that I have encountered from students, faculty, and colleagues that involves creating an online map that has several layers of data, including a historical basemap layer. The other is thinking more and more about what does critical cartography mean in an academic environment, especially from the point of view of libraries.

The workshop then is meant to be an incubator for thinking through these two problems and helping to provide some guidelines so that we can talk to researchers about mapping, data, tools, project management, reproducibility, accessibility, and a range of other issues.    

Some of the overarching themes and questions that have emerged in the process include:

* How can spatial and other visualization methods help to answer or enrich research questions?
* What are the ethical implications of using propriety vs. free tools? 
* What do data management best practices look like for a digital mapping research project?
* What kind of role can visualization, GIS, and other librarians play in providing research support when tools and software are essential to a project?

One of the aims of this workshop is for participants to come away with some best practices and guidelines for working with researchers in order to appraoch these questions and others. In particular, the workshop aims to address how we as librarians can better become part of the research process and work with researchers so that they have a better appreciation of all the different things that must happen in order for a digital mapping project to exist in the first place. 

The idea of the ecosystem is that any mapping or digital project will necessarily have parts and pieces from all sorts of different places. The aim is to show how some of these tools overlap, how they can be used with one another, and ultimately how you can develop the skill set to work with them more directly. One of the things that I really want participants of the workshop to take away is a better understanding of how a digital map is produced, from the underlying code to the structure of a dataset. 

For this workshop I have focused on CARTO, Mapbox, and Github as a provisional set of tools and platforms that can help to create a personal research environment that not only allows you to work with and manage multiple layers of spatial data, but one with which you can also publish and share your project online. Moreover, these tools provide a counter example to the more mainstream alternative of ArcGIS which is often the default choice for working and publishing map related projects. In addition, CARTO has recently partnered with Github to become part of a student developer pack of tools and software. This is a new model that needs to be explored by libraries and how it might impact instruction and outreach.

I have selected data and maps from my own personal research project that I hope will resonate with others as well as be adaptable. The workshop will use data from the Green Book, the Homeowner's Loan Corporation, as well as various local Los Angeles based data. At least in part, most participants will be able to something that might be more local to their own communities. 

The aim of this workshop is to think about how we think about providing mapping

The workshop started to take shape after last years DLF in which I helped to organize a panel on [Critical Cartography](https://dlfforum2017.sched.com/event/Bzsk/t3b-critical-cartography-across-the-digital-library).
