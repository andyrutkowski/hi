I will be teaching a workshop at the 2018 DLF called Digital Mapping Ecosystems. This workshop has been a work in progress for several years and I wanted to give a little background of why I wanted to do it at DLF and some of the goals and outcomes that I envision.

# Why
There are two sets of motivating factors that have helped to shape the workshop. One is based on a frequent request that I have encountered from students, faculty, and colleagues that involves creating an online map that has several layers of data, including a historical basemap layer. The other is thinking more and more about what does critical cartography mean in an academic environment, especially from the point of view of libraries.
 
The workshop is meant to be an incubator for thinking through these two problems and helping to provide a framework for when we talk with researchers about mapping, data, tools, project management, reproducibility, accessibility, and a range of other issues. In particular, the workshop aims to address how we as librarians can better become part of the research process and work with researchers so that they have a better appreciation of all the different things that must happen in order for a digital mapping project to exist in the first place.

Beyond talking about tools and software, this workshop also features an intentional set of data and maps that I hope will be instructive, inspirational, and adaptable to local communities. The workshop will use data from the Green Book, the Homeowner's Loan Corporation, as well as various local data about Los Angeles. Most participants will be able to replicate some form of this research project with their own local communities.

# Ecosystems
The idea of the ecosystem is that any mapping or digital project will necessarily have parts and pieces from all sorts of different places. The aim is to show how all of these moving pieces overlap, how they can be used with one another, and how you can work with them more directly. 

Some of the questions that have guided me in the process of developing this workshop include:
* How can spatial and other visualization methods help to answer or enrich research questions?
* What are the ethical implications of using propriety vs. free tools? 
* What do data management best practices look like for a digital mapping research project?
* What kind of role can librarians play in providing research support when tools and software are essential to a project?
* How we can provide a workshop model that moves beyond teaching tools and instead facilitate a space to talk about the process and methods of mapping?
* How can we help to support critical cartography as librarians?
 
For this workshop I have focused on CARTO, Mapbox, and Github as a provisional set of tools and platforms that can help to create a research environment that not only allows you to work with and manage multiple layers of spatial data, but one with which you can also publish and share your project online. Moreover, these tools provide a counterexample to the more mainstream alternative of ArcGIS which is often the default choice for working with and publishing map related projects. In addition, CARTO has recently partnered with Github to become part of a student developer pack of tools and software. This is a new model that needs to be explored by libraries and how it might impact instruction and outreach. The workshop is easily adaptable to other tools and software, such as Tableau, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS desktop, Google Earth Pro, and QGIS. 

# Outcomes

My goal for workshop participants is that they come away with some solid strategies for providing research support that is holistic and critical. Participants will learn specific skills about tools, software, and data management but more importantly they will come away with concrete ideas for how to approach working with researchers who want to create digital mapping projects that explore and develop research questions.

The workshop started to take shape after last years DLF in which I helped to organize a panel on [Critical Cartography](https://dlfforum2017.sched.com/event/Bzsk/t3b-critical-cartography-across-the-digital-library).
