I will be teaching a workshop at the 2018 DLF in Las Vegas called Digital Mapping Ecosystems. This workshop has been an ongoing work in progress for several years and I wanted to give a little background of why I wanted to do it at DLF and some of the goals and outcomes that I envision.

One of the most simple yet complicated consultation and teaching scenarios that I encounter is when a research question has several layers of data that require visualization. In many of these cases one of the layers is a historical map. The request from students and faculty is to piece all of these things together on an interactive map that can be made accessible to other researchers or students.

There are numerous solutions of addressing this problem and depending on your institution and your access to different software and tools you will probably have your own way of answering this type of question. 

What I have been wanting to do is try to create a workshop where a critical conversation can occur about how and why we use certain tools. 

Some of the overarching themes that have emerged in the process and have become a part of this dialogue and workshop model include:

* How can spatial and other visualization methods help to answer or enrich research questions?
* What are the ethical implications of using propriety vs. free tools. 
* What do data management best practices look like for a digital mapping research project?

Most importantly my goal has been to create a workshop model where a participant can come away with a better appreciation of all the different things that must happen in order for a digital mapping project to exist in the first place. The idea of the ecosystem is that any mapping or digital project will necessarily have parts and pieces from all sorts of different places. The aim is to show how some of these tools overlap, how they can be used with one another, and ultimately how you can develop the skill set to work with them more directly. One of the things that I really want participants of the workshop to take away is a better understanding of how a digital map is produced, from the underlying code to the structure of a dataset. 

For this workshop I have focused on CARTO, Mapbox, and Github as a provisional set of tools and platforms. One of the major reasons that I have chosen these tools and platforms is that you can create a personal research environment that not only allows you to work with and manage multiple layers of spatial data, but you can publish and share that project online. Moreover, these tools provide a counter example to the more mainstream alternative of ArcGIS which is often the default choice for working and publishing map related projects. In addition, CARTO has recently partnered with Github to become part of a student developer pack of tools and software. This has resulted in a higher bar of access for students looking to create accounts but at the same time accounts are more robust and offer more storage and features.  

The aim of this workshop is . . .
