Looking forward to debuting a workshop at DLF 2018 about how to navigate through the different software and tools available for creating web maps. This has been an ongoing project for several years now and it is focused on creating a personal ecosystem of sorts where you can explore spatial research and share it out easily. The idea is to cut through the technology and get down to making maps that you can share and interect with.
